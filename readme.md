Anyone Can enjoy the 2048 game.

Its rule is simple:
1. push the numbers(w/a/s/d) and the same numbers will be merged once. 
2. If there is blank space in its path, it will go through it until it mets other number.
3. If there is no space to move or merge, your game is over.
4. If your Maximum Number is over than 2048, Congraduations! You won the game!

Your Goal is moving Numbers in 4 directions to make Highest Score.

Good Luck!
